# Introduction - Day 1

I have successfully completed **Day 1** of the #90DaysOfDevOps Challenge with the #TrainWithShubham Community! Here's an overview of my progress:

1. **Forked the Repository:**
   - I forked the repository from Shubham's GitHub to track my progress and contribute effectively.

2. **Started with a DevOps Roadmap:**
   - I watched the introductory video on DevOps and explored its roadmap: [DevOps Roadmap](https://youtu.be/g_QHuGq3E2Y?si=fR9K56-JevZTfrBK).

3. **My LinkedIn Post:**
   - I shared my understanding of DevOps, automation, scaling, and infrastructure in a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/urvish-suhagiya-b19a89266_90daysofdevops-trainwithshubham-devops-activity-7248377019518832640-M820?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).
   
   - Here's the summary:

     - **What is DevOps:**
     DevOps is a collaborative approach that unites development and operations teams to automate and streamline processes, enhancing the efficiency of delivering software.

     - **What is Automation, Scaling, and Infrastructure:**
     Automation in DevOps is about creating workflows that require minimal manual intervention, while scaling ensures that applications can handle growing demand. Infrastructure in DevOps refers to the management and provisioning of computing resources, often through Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) practices.

     - **Why DevOps is Important:**
     DevOps bridges the gap between development and operations, reduces time to market, enhances software quality, and fosters a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement.
